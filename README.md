# SmartConverter
I am going to be creating a SmartConverter that will allow users to easily convert between different units of measurement, such as length, weight, and temperature. 
I would use the calculator GUI to take user input, like what value needs to be converted and the units of measurement for said input value, and then use a conversion formula to convert the input value to the desired output unit.
