# SmartConverter
I am going to be creating a SmartConverter that will allow users to easily convert between (the most confusing) units of measurement, kilometers, millimeters, meters, and centimeters. 
I am using Tkinter to create a GUI application that takes user input, like what value needs to be converted and the units of measurement for said input value, and then using a conversion formula to convert the input value to the desired output unit.
